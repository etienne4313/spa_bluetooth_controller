/* Bluetooth HC-05 module needs to be programmed using serial AT command
 * So here we need to have a USD to serial converter ==? Simply let the nano in reset ( plug reset into GND )a
 * SET EN to 1 to go in CMD mode
 * 	SWAP RX/TX
 * Then Nano RX is USB TX ==> 1K / 1K into HC05 RXD
 * Then Nano TX is USB RX ==> into HC05 TXD
 * Command MODE is 38000 from the Adruino Terminal
 * 	AT+NAME=myname
 * 	AT+UART=115200,1,0
 *
 * RXD on the HC05 always 1K /1K protected.
 * When programming the NANO the Bluetooth connection can interfere so may need to disconnect
 *
 * When communicating with bluetooth module we cannnot open the terminal at the same time.
